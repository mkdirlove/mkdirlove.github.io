It is very rich in vegetables and seafood. It was so much fun to be with my cousins and I even got to know them so much. I like the time I'm there because I just relax and I don't feel bored because there are many things to do.</li>

	<ul>
	   <li>In my life the most embarrassing event I ever did was I was alone on the first day of school I was late and I still don't know where my room is. While the teacher was lecturing, I came in and everyone looked at me, I immediately sat down. After that the teacher called all our names to check the attendance, did not call my name so I asked immediately. The reason I wasn't called was because I entered the wrong room.</li>
